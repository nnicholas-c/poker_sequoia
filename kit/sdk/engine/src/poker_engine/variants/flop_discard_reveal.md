Standard no-limit hold'em, with three private cards and a simultaneous choice after the flop.

## Rules

- Deal three private hole cards per player from one standard 52-card deck. Play normal preflop betting.
- After dealing the flop and before flop betting, every non-folded player chooses one card to discard face down and one of the other two to expose. Lock every choice before publishing the exposed cards together. There are six legal combinations.
- The discarded card stays out of play and private to its owner. The exposed card stays in the hand and remains public, including if its owner later folds. The other retained card stays hidden until normal showdown disclosure.
- Continue normal flop, turn, and river betting. At showdown, use the best five cards from the board and two retained cards, using zero, one, or both hole cards. Every player still in automatically reveals both retained cards, including losing hands; there is no mucking. The discard never plays or becomes public at showdown. If everyone else folds, the winner does not reveal their hidden card.
- All-in players also choose. Pause automatic runouts at the flop for selection; do not disclose full all-in hands before the river showdown.
- If everyone but one player folds before selection, award the pot without selection. Choosing costs no chips and does not change betting order or side-pot eligibility.
- On a failed selection (timeout, exception, or invalid action), discard the last-dealt card and expose the first-dealt card. This does not fold the player or surrender an all-in pot.
- Blinds, antes, raises, side pots, uncalled refunds, and automatic showdown disclosure follow the hold'em reference. Selection uses the normal decision time limit, time bank, and table memory. The variant supports 2–10 players.

## Bot interface

- At `state.phase == "select"`, `state.cards` contains the three cards in original dealing order. Return `Action("select", cards=(discard_index, reveal_index))`. Both indexes must be distinct integers from 0 to 2, and `amount` must be zero.
- For example, `Action("select", cards=(2, 0))` discards the third card and exposes the first. Empty `cards` explicitly requests this same default choice. The supplied template and examples already use the default in unfamiliar phases.
- Selection requests are collected in seat order, but no selection changes visible cards until all players have submitted. Public `select` acknowledgements contain no card indexes or identities. Subsequent players cannot see earlier players' choices.
- After resolution, `state.cards` contains the two retained cards in their original relative order. `state.seats[].shown_cards` contains each player's exposed card. A `reveal` event identifies the seat and that card. Later ordinary `show` events disclose both retained cards.
- `state.variant["discarded"]` contains only this bot's discarded card, or an empty list before resolution. Neither `select` nor `reveal` events expose the discarded card.
- Betting uses the existing action API; showdown reveals are automatic without a bot turn.
- eval7's ranges and equity helpers (`HandRange`, `py_hand_vs_range_*`) assume two hole cards; `eval7.evaluate` ranks the best five of whatever cards it is given. Before selection you hold three.

A minimal selection handler is:

```python
if state.phase == "select":
    return Action("select", cards=(2, 0)), memory
```

Improve the choice of retained cards and which one to expose; account for opponents' exposed cards in later decisions.

## Hand history

- A hand's public `cards` for a seat are the cards it last made public: its exposed card after a `reveal` event, or both retained cards after a `show`.
- Your private `cards` are the three cards you were dealt, in dealing order, including your discard. They do not record which card you discarded or exposed. When your retained cards are later shown, you can infer the discard by comparing them with the deal; if you fold or win without showing, the exposed card alone may leave the discard and the other retained card ambiguous. New histories also identify your own retained and discarded cards in owner-only `private_events`.
- An automatic selection uses the fallback above. The sample's choices are scripted, not a suggested policy.

## Prize statistics

- **The Empty Bluffer** counts hands won without showdown after exposing a 2, 3, 4, or 5 and then betting or raising at least once.
- **The Shover** counts hands in which the player bets or raises all in, committing their entire remaining stack, on any street, win or lose. All-in calls and forced blinds do not qualify.
- **Calling Station** ranks the share of the player's betting decisions that are calls: calls ÷ (folds + checks + calls + bets and raises), counted over all the scored rounds together. Equal shares go to the player with more calls. There is no minimum number of decisions. An all-in call for less than the full amount counts as a call. Every betting action counts, including a check or fold the platform plays for a bot that times out or fails. Forced blinds and flop selections are not decisions.

Hand histories record each Empty Bluffer or Shover award as a `prize_the_empty_bluffer` or `prize_the_shover` event for the seat, at most once per seat per hand. These events move no chips and can come during betting or after the final `stack` events. The admin prize table sums these raw counts across scored rounds, without tournament weights. Calling Station adds no events to hand histories: your share is your `call` events out of all your `fold`, `check`, `call` and `raise` events.
